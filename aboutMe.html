        <h1>hi</h1>
        <h3>who</h3>
        <p>
            I'm abstractionAlpha!
            I am 19 and a current university student studying computer science.
            I like to program stuff and am primarily interested in Minecraft, since I played that game since I was little.
            My other "main" game is Splitgate, sometimes.
            I'd love to be able to develop for a gaming industry I like while I work on my own stuff in the meantime.
        </p>
        <p>
            As far as programming, my primary languages are Java (which is why I have such an interest in Minecraft development) and C/C++.
            I also know Python and a little R, but I want to learn more! I will when I need to for a job or job application...
            Probably SQL and mySQL next in order to add extensibility and web support for my programs.
            My computer science interests are mostly efficient algorithms and artificial intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of programming, I solve Rubik's cubes with a specialization in the 3x3x3, and do calisthenics (but I'm just starting to get into it).
            I'm interested in criminology because I like problem solving, and math for the same reason.
            My favorite color is orange and my favorite foods are pizza and sushi.
            (How interesting, right? &#128580;)
            I voted for the Copper Golem in the 2021 Minecraft LIVE mob vote.
            I have a black cat who was born in June 2021 named Basil, and I love him very much. : )
        </p>
        <h3>what</h3>
        <p>
            Right now, my main work is doing software-defined network engineering experiments and DevOps for the FABRIC testbed.
            I also do research for my university in optimization of algorithms and spacetime physics.
            As far as work, I'm always open to opportunities for development and programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a hobby mostly I program plugins and mods for Minecraft.
            I haven't gotten too involved with those things, so for now, I still have a lot to learn...
            But moving forward, I'm totally interested in branching out to other games, or even making my own stuff!
            I want to learn how to use game engines so I can create my own systems and whatnot.
            Generally speaking, I want to learn more about programming and development to be the best I can be.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm not actively streaming or content creating right now, but I'm on
            <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/abstractionalpha">Twitch</a>,
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV4SaR-M3BsaC8DmPg08WfQ">YouTube</a>,
            and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@abstractionalpha">TikTok</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>why</h3>
        <p>
            Programming is more than just a hobby!
            Ever since I was a kid (and still a huge nerd), I was interested in making particularly video games.
            Now, I'm just interested in software development as a whole, but that still includes game development!
            After college, I plan to make computer science my full-time career, hopefully pursuing something related to artificial intelligence,
            which is one of the largest growing computer science fields as it is now.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have my own ideas, too, so while I'm at work I will also be working on those personal projects, and for-fun projects like (mostly) what is found on this site.
