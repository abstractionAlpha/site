        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            Minecraft Manhunt is a Minecraft (Java edition) server plugin that is meant to replicate the Minecraft Manhunt series by WilburSoot, revolutionized by Dream.
            This plugin uses multi-threading and basic object-oriented design in order to create the gamemode.
        </p>
        <p>
            Commands:
            <ul>
                <li><code>manhunt</code>: Loads the GUI for Minecraft Manhunt. See more about usage below.</li>
            </ul>
            Permissions:
            <ul>
                <li><code>manhunt.main</code>: Allows use of the <code>manhunt</code> command.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Usage</h3>
        <h5>Workflows</h5>
        <p>
            The main and only workflow of this plugin is with the <code>manhunt</code> command.
        </p>
        <p>
            On executing the command, given appropriate permissions are had, the player who executed it will be presented with a GUI.
            This GUI can only be accessed by one player at a time, and cannot be accessed once the game has started.
            The GUI has three components:
            <ul>
                <li>A <i>Runners</i> button, implemented as a player head</li>
                <li>A <i>Hunters</i> button, implemented as a player head</li>
                <li>A <i>Confirm</i> button, implemented as a piece of stained clay</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>Runners</b> button opens a separate GUI that contains a whole bunch of player heads.
            Each player head in this tab is the head of a runner.
            The runners are stored in an array sorted by name.
            If you left-click on one of the players, they will be moved from this list to the Hunters list.
            If this list is empty, it will just show a steve. If you click the steve head, then it will open the Hunters list.
        </p>

            The <b>Hunters</b> button opens a separate GUI that contains a bunch of player heads.
            Each player head in this tabe is the head of a hunter.
            The hunters are stored in an array sorted by name.
            If you left-click on one of the players, they wil be moved from this list to the Runners list.
            If this list is empty, it will just show a steve. If you click the steve head, then it will open the Runners list.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>Confirm</b> button is a piece of stained clay.
            It is red if either of the two lists are empty, and green otherwise (until later pressed).
            If the clay is red then pressing the button doesn't do anything.
            If the clay is green then pressing the button will turn the clay blue.
            If the clay is blue then pressing the button will start the game. (See <b>Gameplay</b> section)
        </p>
        <h5>Gameplay</h5>
        <p>
            After going through the main workflow, the game begins!
            All players can play Minecraft as normal
            (unless friendly fire is turned off in the config).
            If all of the hunters die, then the game ends.
        </p>
        <p>
            The location of each runner is held in a backing store, simply in the form of an object represnting the runner.
            The runners' positions will automatically be updated whenever any runner goes through any portal.
            The runners' positions can be manually updated if a hunter right-clicks their tracking compass.
            The hunters' compasses update automatically when they go through a portal,
            as well as manually when they right-click said compass.
        </p>
        <p>
            When any runner dies, all players will recieve a notification.
            If both runners die, the game ends and all of the dynamic objects are destroyed for a fresh run.
